# Colemak Tutor

## What is the game?
The overall goal of this game is to be a simple but enjoyable way to learn and practice the Colemak layout (and its variants).

Some things that I want to accomplish with this project:
 - Find an enjoyable and well-paced approach to learning Colemak and Colemak-DH in particular
 - Have the ability to support and display any type of physical keyboard layout (ANSI, ISO, ergonomic, split, etc.)
 - Be able to teach and practice other typing skills such as:
   - English bi/trigrams (common letter clusters)
   - Standard or proprietary layouts for numbers and symbols
 - Capture and display the words-per-minute in real-time and after the practice session
 - Save user statistics and display trends over time
