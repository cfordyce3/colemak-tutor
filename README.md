# Colemak Tutor

## What is the game?
The overall goal of this game is to be a simple but enjoyable way to learn and practice the Colemak layout (and its variants).

Some primary things that I want to accomplish with this project:
 - Find an enjoyable and well-paced approach to learning Colemak and Colemak-DH in particular
 - Have the ability to support and display any type of physical keyboard layout (ANSI, ISO, ergonomic, split, etc.)
   - Possibly the ability to design your own virtual layout to be displayed
 - Be able to teach and practice other typing skills such as:
   - English bi/trigrams (common letter clusters)
   - Standard or proprietary layouts for numbers and symbols
 - Capture and display the words-per-minute in real-time and after the practice session
 - Save user statistics and display trends over time

Some smaller details I'd like to add:
 - Ability to toggle between deleting a single character upon making a mistake and forcing yourself to rewrite the whole word again for improved practice
 - Ability to use other layouts (dvorak, workman, even qwerty)
 - While typing, the correct key and finger will display on the virtual keyboard
